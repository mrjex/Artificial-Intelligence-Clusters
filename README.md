# AI Project - Joel Mattsson's Clustering Implementations

This system was developed as an individual assignment in 2024 December during my exchange studies in Italy. It covers a clustering problem in machine learning that fetches hand-written images from MNIST database. Using unsupervised learning, it is up to the clustering methods to correctly partition the data instances. This is the third assignment of `Foundations of Artificial Intelligence` and it emphasized focus on the writing part, which can be found in `Report.pdf`. However, the coding part was also essential, since the results derived from the performances were used to obtain insights and make conclusions. Below, are the techniques implemented in this assignment:


- **Principal Component Analysis:** *Dimensionality reduction for MNIST database*

- **Gaussian Mixture Model:** *First clustering method*

- **Mean Shift:** *Second clustering method*

- **Normalized Cut:** *Third clustering method*

- **Rand Index:** *Evaluation score of the three aforementioned clusters

## Getting Started

In `main.py` inside the function *run_models* comment or uncomment the clustering methods in accordance with the ones you want to run or exclude from the exuection. In addition, you as a developer are faced with two options. Either you run the clustering methods or visualize the data generated by them. Hence, you either tell the system to produce new output, or visualize based on the data contained in the generated output data contained in the JSON files. Furthermore, everything in the `/models` directory is concerned with running the actual clusters to *produce*, in constrast to `output` that focuses on elaborating on existing data.


## Outut

This directory contains two subdirectories:


### Data Directory

Consists of JSON data generated from the latest execution of the system. All JSON files are following a consistent structure, which can be found in `schemas.yml`. Since the three clustering methods are similar in nature and they are applied to the same MNIST data, this generalization was viable. However, the parameters for *Mean Shift* was slightly different in comparison to *Normalized Cut* and the *GMM Model*. Instead of using the *K* parameter that denotes the number of nearest clusters to include in the computations, it used *Kernel-Width*, or also known as *Bandwitch*. This parameter is used as a radius that detects the data points that fall within a radar instead. For this reason, the schema naming conventions are divided based on *Clusters* and *Kernel-Width* in `schemas.yml`.



### Visualization Directory

Consists of PNGs generated from the JSON data. All of the visaulizations bring insight into the clustering qualities that are highlighted by the *Rand Index* score. Three of the visualizations compare how different PCA levels and K-values or Kernel-Width impact the clustering quality using line charts. Lastly, an average of all values for each respective clustering method aggregated into a bar chart:
